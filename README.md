## Fake News Detection

This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. We collected real and fake news datasets, preprocessed the text data, and applied TF-IDF vectorization to extract relevant features. A Logistic Regression classifier was then trained on this data to accurately differentiate between real and fake news. The system was built in Python using libraries such as `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `newspaper3k`. Additionally, it includes a zero-shot classification model using Hugging Face Transformers for cross-verification and a Google Fact Check API integration for real-time claim validation.
